UBZ Control panel code

This repository contains code for an UBZ device. It is intended to use by the corresponding device template that loads content of the panel.html file and applies proper device identifier to it. The panel displays real-time data and graphs from the device, and allows for control of certain device settings. Note that the code requires Bootstrap and Chart.js to work properly.
